The Pillar - is a web application meant to be used by "The Pillar"-a student publication of the University of Eastern Philippines. As an IT student in that university, this is what me and partner did for our capstone project.

To run this app you need to do the following:

- run "pipenv install" - this should install all the neccessarry packages needed.
- you should have MySQL installed on your machine.
- in the files "docker-compose.yml" and "dev.py" configure the database credentials based on the configuration you have on your MySQL.
- run "python manage.py runserver" - the app should be up and running.
